How many times do you think I've watched her die? I've seen it again and again and again and again and again and again... It won't destroy me. The number of times I see it doesn't matter!

Do you hear what you're saying? Mayuri's going to suffer and die. How can you say it doesn't matter? If that doesn't affect you, then your heart's already broken.

It feels like time is passing so quickly. Damn you, Einstein! Your science is crowding in on our kiss! He was right. The passage of time depends entirely on where you're standing. Relativity Theory... it's so romantic. But it's just so tragic too.

It's all my fault. From start to finish, it's my fault. I'm the one who told Daru to hack into SERN. I'm the one whose stupid idea it was to build a time machine to begin with and the one who brought Moeka into her lives. I'm the reason that Mayuri... *sobs*

Consider, can the universe be justifiably called infinite? Doubtful. It may not have a discernible end, but it had a beginning and its component parts definitely have a limited cosmological shelf-life.

Splitting hairs or not, if history tells us anything, it's that scientists often make very poor poets. We're all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms heedless of what really underwrites natural law.

The universe has a beginning, but no end. — Infinity. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction. — Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools.
History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.

You care more about your friends than anything else, so I think it's going to be painful for you. I'm so sorry. But that pain will mean a lot to me.

There was a scientific rationale for that! Because... important memories, including, but not limited to, one's first kiss, are stored in the hippocampus, which makes them harder to forget. So I figured...

Okabe... I'm sure that, from now on, you're going to suffer. You'll be in a world where no one but you remembers me... You care about your friends more than anything else... so I think it'll be painful for you. I'm sorry. But that pain will mean a lot to me.

Whenever you're sitting around in the lab... Whenever you sip a drink... Whenever you walk around town... Whenever you kiss someone someday... It doesn't have to be every time. One time out of a hundred is fine. All I ask is that you remember me...
Because I'll be there... I'll always be there, beyond the 1% barrier. Okabe... Okabe... Okabe...
