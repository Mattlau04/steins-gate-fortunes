Quotes from Steins;Gate to use with the [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) command
### PRs to add new quotes are welcome, just make sure to generate a new .dat file with `strfile steins-gate steins-gate.dat`

## How to install

### If you want those to appear in the regular fortune command
Place or symlink `steins-gate` and `steins-gate.dat` in the `/usr/share/fortune/` folder  
Now they have a chance to run using the regular `fortune` command, and you can get a garanted Steins;Gate one using `fortune steins-gate` no matter your current directory

### If you don't want those to appear in the regular fortune command
Download `steins-gate` and `steins-gate.dat` in a folder, then cd into that folder and use `fortune steins-gate`
